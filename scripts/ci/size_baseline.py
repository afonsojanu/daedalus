"""A ratchet on module size, pointing the opposite way to the coverage one.

Nothing stopped a module that was already too large from taking on one more
responsibility, and the largest files here got that way a few lines at a time
with every individual commit looking reasonable.

The rule is not a line limit. A file over its ceiling is listed in BASELINE at
the size it was measured and may not exceed it; every other file must stay
under the ceiling. Growing a listed file is allowed, because some fixes
genuinely belong in it, but only by editing its recorded number in the same
commit — where a reviewer sees the monolith getting bigger instead of
inferring it from a diffstat.

Shrinking is the direction this exists to reward, so it costs the author
nothing: `--tighten` follows a file down, and CI runs it beside the coverage
ratchet. Without that the bound would stay where the file used to be and the
lines could come back for free, which is the same slack the coverage floor had
when its recorded measurement went stale.

  python3 scripts/ci/size_baseline.py            # report violations, exit 1 on any
  python3 scripts/ci/size_baseline.py --tighten  # follow shrunk files down

`--tighten` never raises a number and never adds an entry: growth stays a
decision somebody makes and a reviewer sees.
